//- All source code and documentation used in my program is

//
//- I have not discussed coding details about this project with
//anyone other than my partner (in the case of a joint
//submission), instructor, ACM/UPE tutors or the TAs assigned
//to this course. I understand that I may discuss the concepts
//of this program with other students, and that another student
//may help me debug my program so long as neither of us writes
//anything during the discussion or modifies any computer file
//during the discussion. I have violated neither the spirit nor
//letter of this restriction.
